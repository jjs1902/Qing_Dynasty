            of Wu and other Chinese generals, the Manchus
            resistance. Initially meeting with little opposition,
            the Manchus won te allegiance of government of-
            ficials and local gentry, many of whom welcomed
            the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> as deliverance from banditry and rebellion.
            In October 1644 the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> capital was transferred
            to Beijing. The conquest of South <span style="color:red;">China</span> was much more
            prolonged. The Ming government there had not
            been destroyed by rebellion. Several Ming loyalist
            regimes vied for succession, and one controlled parts
            of southwest <span style="color:red;">China</span> for fifteen years. Zheng Chenggong
            (1624-1662), also known as Koxinga, led a
            sustained Ming loyalist movement on the southeast
            coast and Taiwan. In 1673 Wu Sangui and two other
            Chinese generals, Shang Kexi and Geng Jimao,
            rebelled and set up separatist regimes in the south.
            This rebellion was quelled in 1681. Two years later
            the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> conquered Taiwan and defeated the last
            Min resistance.[<i>See also </i> Li Zicheng; Zheng Chenggong;

            <b><span style="color:blue">Qing</span> Government.</b> The <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> dynasty became
            more sinicized under the Shunzhi emperor (r. 1644-1661)
            The first Manchu monarch to master the
            Chinese language, he revived the Hanlin Academy,
            a stronghold of Confucian scholarship and
            orthodoxy, and relied greatly on Chinese officials and
            eunuchs. The pendulum swung back toward Manchu
            control upon his death. His seven-year-old son
            was chosen to rule as the Kangxi emperor(r. 1661-1722),
            aided by a regency of four Manchu princes.
            After Kangxi assumed personal power in 1669, he
            institutionalized the privileged position of Manchus
            by reserving for them top positions in the bureau-
            cracy. Each of the Six Boards had one Chinese and
            one Manchu minister: only half of the grand
            secretaries were Chinese. Although Chinese were often
            appointed provincial governors and filled almost all
            lower positions, they were generally supervised by
            Manchu, Mongol, or Chinese bannermen serving as
            governors-general. [<i>See also</i> Kangxi Emperor.]

            <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> government followed Ming administrative
            practices, with some minor modifications. Each of
            the eighteen provinces was administered by a governor.
            He was supervised by a governor-general,
            who usually oversaw two provinces. Below the
            provincial administration was a hierarchy of circuits,
            prefectures, and districts. The district magistrate,
            representing the lowest level of formal government,
            was aided in his duties by local gentry, mostly degree
            holders and their families.formal mechanisms for social mobility lagged 
            behind population growth.

         <p>
            <b><span style="color:blue">Qing</span> Thought and Literature.</b> The trauma of the
            Manchu conquest led Chinese scholars to concern
            themselves with te causes of Ming collapse. Huang
            Zongxi (1610-1695) advocated checks on the
            power ot monarchs and delegation of authority; Gu
            Yanwu (1612-1682) criticized Neo-Confucian
            scholasticism and called for the pursuit of practical
            knowledge. Scholars continued to regard the classics
            as the basis of all learning. Gradually a "school of
            empirical research” (<i>kaozheng xue</i>) emerged, based
            on close examination of classical texts and use of
            the inductive method. This led to advances in philology
            and etymology, and also to reassessment of or
            thodox interpretations of the classics-particularly
            by Dai Zhen (1724-1777). [<i>See also</i> Huang Zongxi;

            The state sponsored and controlled most aca-
            demic activity. The Qianlong emperor (r. 1736-
            1795) ordered the compilation of the 36,000-volume
            “Complete Library of the Four Treasuries". At
            the same time, he ordered a literary inquisition to
            destroy books regarded as seditious.
            Fiction flourished during the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> period. Novels
            reached their acme with <i>Honglou meng (The Dream</i>
            <i>-of the Red Chamber,</i> also entitled <i>The Story of the</i>
            <i>Stone)</i> by Cao Xueqin (1715?-1763). Another well
            known novel of the period is Wu Jingzi's <i>Rulin</i>
            <i>waishi (The Scholars).</i> [<i>See also</i> Chinese Literature;

            <b>Dynastic Decline.</b> By the end of the eighteenth
            century many of the classic signs of dynastic decline
            had appeared. Administrative deterioration was ex
            emplified by the career of Heshen (1750-1799), a
            Manchu courtier who became a favorite of the
            Qianlong emperor and rose rapidly from bodyguard
            to grand councillor. Heshen's high status symbol
            ized official corruption and demoralization. [<i>See</i>

            The White Lotus Rebellion, sparked by a mille
            narian religious sect, broke out in 1796. The sect
            had won adherents among the volatile and unsettled
            population of west central <span style="color:red;">China</span>, and was moti
            vated in part by opposition to official oppression.
            Armed groups such as bandits and smugglers joined
            the uprising, which the regular <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> banner forces
            proved unable to subdue. Eventually the uprising
            was put down by a locally organized militia, and by
            1805 the White Lotus rebels had been annihilated.

            The rebellion was both a symptom and a cause
            of dynastic decline. It resulted from social pressures
            and administrative deterioration, and it hastened the
            fiscal and military decline ot the dynasty. As a result,
            the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> was already weakened when challenged by
            te Western powers.<i>Relations with the West.</i> Until the nineteenth
            century, Sino-Western contact posed little threat to
            te Qing. As it expanded into Inner Asia, the Qing
            met Russian continental expansion; after some
            minor conflicts, however, the two empires signed the
            treaties of Nerchinsk (1689) and Kiakhta (1727) to
            regulate trade and define their borders.

            Western maritime trade with <span style="color:red;">China</span> began early
            in the sixteenth century with the arrival ot Portuguese
            and Dutch ships on the southeast coast. By
            1760 the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> government had restricted Western
            maritime trade to Canton (Guangzhou). European
            merchants were permitted only seasonal residence
            in Canton and allowed to trade only with the
            Cohong, a government-chartered merchant guild. [<i>See</i>

            Great <span style="color:darkgrey;">Britain</span> emerged as <span style="color:red;">China</span>’s major Western
            trading partner. The tea trade, monopolized by the
            East India Company, became an important source
            of british revenue. In order to improve <span style="color:darkgrey;">Britain</span>'s
            unfavorable balance of payments, the East India Commy
            began to grow opium in India and sell it to
            private traders who smuggled it into <span style="color:red;">China</span>. british
            opium trade with <span style="color:red;">China</span> doubled in the 1830s. The
            opium trade was illegal—<span style="color:red;">China</span> outlawed opium, a
            severely addictive and debilitating drug, in 1729.
            Moreover, the opium trade reversed te trade
            balance, disrupting the Chinese economy. The Qing
            government in 1838 dispatched Commissioner Lin
            Zexu to Canton to suppress the opium trade. british
            resistance sparked the Opium War (1839-1842).

            <b>The Treaty System.</b> After three years of warfare,
            <span style="color:red;">China</span> sued for peace and was forced to sign the
            Treaty of Nanjing in 1842. The treaty opened five
            ports to british trade and gave british subjects
            extraterritorial privileges in <span style="color:red;">China</span>. In addition, <span style="color:red;">China</span>
            was required to pay an indemnity and cede the island
            of Hong Kong (Xianggang) to <span style="color:darkgrey;">Britain</span>.
            Other Western countries soon signed similar
            treaties with <span style="color:red;">China</span>. Each successive treaty expanded
            foreign privileges. Eventually the treaty system
            opened inland waterways, allowed missionaries into
            <span style="color:red;">China</span>’s interior, and deprived <span style="color:red;">China</span> of tariff
            autonomy. After <span style="color:darkgrey;">Britain</span> and France defeated <span style="color:red;">China</span> in
            the Second Opium War (also known as the Arrow
            War; 1856-1860), <span style="color:red;">China</span> permitted foreign legations
            to be established in Beijing for the first time.

            <b>Nineteenth-century Rebellions.</b> The Opium War
            and the shift of trade to treaty ports north of Canton
            disrupted the economy of Guangdong Province.
            Economic dislocation increased popular unrest and
            provided the backdrop to the Taiping Rebellion
            (1851-1864).
            The Taiping movement was led by Hong Xiuquan
            (1813-1864),who had been exposed to Christianity
            in Canton. Convinced that he was the younger
            brother ot Jesus, Hong founded a sect and in 1851
            proclaimed the inauguration of the "Heavenly Kingdom
            of Great Peace” (<i>taiping tianguo</i>). His army
            marched north and by 1853 took Nanjing, which
            became the Taiping capital.
         </p>
         <p>
            Taiping ideology combined elements of
            Christianity with Chinese utopian thought. lt envisioned
            equal distribution of land, sexual equality, and communal
            property. Taiping social policies prohibited
            use of opium, slavery, polygamy, and the binding
            of women’s feet. However, the Taiping movement
            suffered from internecine warfare; moreover, its
            religious intolerance and hostility to much of
            traditional culture lost it popular support. <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> loyalists
            eventually rallied behind provincial armies orga-
            nized by Zeng Guofan (1811-1872) and others. The
            Taipings were suppressed by 1864. [<i>See also</i> Taiping
            Rebellion <i>and</i> Hong Xiuquan.]
         </p>
         <p>
            The Taiping Rebellion coincided with the Nian
            Rebellion in North <span style="color:red;">China</span> (1853-186́8) and three
            separate Muslim rebellions: in Yunnan (1856-
            1872), in Shaanxi and Gansu (1862-1877), and in
            eastern Turkestan (1864-1878). The Qing
            suppressed the rebellions at the expense ot te central
            government’s authority as provincial officials led
            military operations and won fiscal autonomy. At the
            same time, Han Chinese officials increased their
            influence and the Manchus became less powerful. [<i>See</i>

            <b>Self-Strengthening and Imperialism.</b> After 1860
            the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> adopted a conciliatory policy toward the
            West. Under the leadership ot Prince Gong (Gong
            Yixin; 1833-1898) and Empress Dowager Cixi
            (1835-1908), the government established the Zongli
            Yamen (a foreign affairs office) and a foreign
            language school. Zeng Guofan and his protégé Li
            Hongzhang (1823-1901), leaders of the suppression
            of the Taipings, sought to increase <span style="color:red;">China</span>’s power
            by introducing Western military technology. This
            effort, known as the Self-Strengthening Movement,
            resulted in establishment of te Jiangnan Arsenal
            (1854) and the Fuzhou Shipyard. Eventually, the
            movement also promoted industrial development.
            Several enterprises were established under govern-
            ment supervision and with private capital. [<i>See also</i>

         <p>
            The Self-Strengthening Movement failed to
            increase <span style="color:red;">China</span>’s milirary strength significantly,
            however. In 1884 French ambitions in Vietnam, a
            Chinese protectorate, sparked the Sino-French War
            (1884-1885). Poor coordination and leadership
            resulted in <span style="color:red;">China</span>’s defeat. Ten years later a clash with
            <span style="color:darkblue;">Japan</span> over Korea resulted in the Sino-<span style="color:darkblue;">Japan</span>ese War
            (1894-1895), which <span style="color:darkblue;">Japan</span> won easily. [<i>See also</i>

         <p>
            After <span style="color:red;">China</span>’s defeat, a "scramble for concessions"
            ensued. Germany, Russia, France, and <span style="color:darkgrey;">Britain</span>
            all forced <span style="color:red;">China</span> to lease ports and recognize foreign
            spheres of influence over Chinese territory. Nominal
            Chinese sovereignty was preserved in the foreign
            areas, mainly because the competing powers
            checked each others ambitions. Nonetheless,
            imperialist pressure threatened to destroy <span style="color:red;">China</span>’s
            unity and independence. [<i>See also</i> Imperialism.]

         <p>
            <i>Late <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> Reform.</i> This crisis brought a group of
            reformers to the attention of the Guangxu emperor
            r. 1875-1908). Their leader, Kang Youwei (1858-
            1927), reinterpreted Confucianism to sanction
            radical innovation. In the summer of 1898 the emperor
            issued a series of decrees calling for wide-ranging
            institutional reforms and economie development,
            but official resistance blocked implementation of the
            reforms. In September 1898, conservatives led by
            Empress Dowager Cixi staged a coup d’état. The
            emperor was placed under house arrest; the reformers
            fled into exile or were arrested.
         </p>
         <p>
            The new conservative government soon threw its
            support behind the Boxers (more properly, Yihe-
            tuan, "righteous and harmonious society"), a
            popular movement dedicated to driving Westerners out
            of <span style="color:red;">China</span>. The Boxers occupied Beijing in the
            summer ot 1900 and besieged the foreign legations
            with the connivance of the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> government, which
            declared war on the foreign powers. Regional
            officials in central and southern <span style="color:red;">China</span>, however,
            ignored the declaration of war and maintained
            friendly relations with the powers. An international
            force occupied Beijing in August 1900. In 1901
            <span style="color:red;">China</span> was forced to sign the Boxer Protocol, which
            provided for a foreign military presence in North
            <span style="color:red;">China</span>, punishment for Chinese officials implicated
            in the Boxer movement, and an indemnity. [<i>See also</i>

         </p>
         <p>
            The chastened <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> government thereupon
            undertook an extensive reform program, similar in
            many ways to the one aborted in 1898. A new public
            education system was inaugurated, and in 1905 the
            civil service examination system, based on the
            Confucian classics, was abolished. The traditional Six
            Boards were replaced with new ministries. Modern
            military academies trained a new officer corps and
            Yuan Shikai (1859-1916) established the Beiyang
            Army, a modern military force.
         </p>
         <p>
            <span style="color:darkblue;">Japan</span>'s defeat of Russia in 1905 appeared to
            prove the superiority of constitutionalism over
            autocracy. The <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> government slowly began to
            establish representative assemblies. Provincial assem-
            blies, with advisory functions but not legislative
            powers, were established in 1909. A consultative
            National Assembly met the following year.
            Nevertheless, the Manchu princes controlling de government
            moved cautiously and continued to monopolize
            lize the highest positions, thereby increasing Chinese
            frustrations and resentment.

            <b>The Revolution of 1911.</b> In the decade following
            the Boxer Rebellion, expatriate reformers and
            revolutionaries vied for support. Kang Youwei, in exile
            in <span style="color:darkblue;">Japan</span>, remained loyal to the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> and opposed
            attempts to overthrow the dynasty. His disciple
            Liang Qichao (1873-1929) became familiar with

            Their most important rival was another Chinese
            exile, Sun Yat-sen (1866-1925). Sun was a Western-
            educated Cantonese with ties to overseas Chinese
            communities. In 1905 Sun established a revolution-
            ary organization based in Tokyo, the Tongmenghui
            (Revolutionary Alliance). He promoted republicanism
            and his "Three Principles of the People" -
            nationalism, people’s rights, and people’s livelihood.

            On 10 October 1911 revolutionary soldiers in the
            <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> army garrison in Wuchang mutinied. The au-
            thority of the <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> government rapidly collapsed;
            provincial assemblies in southern and central <span style="color:red;">China</span>
            declared their independence from the Manchus, and
            a provisional government was established in Nanjing.
            Sun Yat-sen returned from a sixteen-year exile
            to be inaugurated as the first president of the Re-
            public of <span style="color:red;">China</span>.

            The <span style="color:blue">Qing</span> court called upon the retired general
            Yuan Shikai to deal with the revolutionaries. Sun
            offered to resign the presidency in favor ot Yuan if
            Yuan were to support the republic. Yuan engineered
            the abdication of the five-year-old Xuantong
            emperor in February 1912, and accepted the presi-
            dency, ending <span style="color:red;">China</span>'s two millennia of imperial
            rule.
